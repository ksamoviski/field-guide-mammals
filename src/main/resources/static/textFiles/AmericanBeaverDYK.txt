The beaver is North Americaâ€™s largest rodent, weighing up to 60 pounds.  They eat bark and cambium, which is the softer growing tissue under the bark of trees.  Their lodges, which are comprised of branches and mud, can reach massive dimensions and can be used for many years.  The largest known beaver dam, in Alberta, Canada, is 2,790 feet long.
