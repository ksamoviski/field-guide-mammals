 An adult is about the size of a house cat, with coarse, grizzled, grayish fur. It has a long, scaly tail, ears without fur, and a long, pointed snout that ends in a pink nose. Quite adaptable and can be found in suburbia and the city. Ideal habitat, however, is an area with woods, wetlands, and farmland interspersed.
