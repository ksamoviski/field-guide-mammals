A female opossum carries 12-13 young internally for approximately two weeks before they are born. Opossums are undeveloped and tiny (1/15 ounce) at birth. The offspring must crawl to a teat in the female’s pouch to survive. At about three months of age, young opossums emerge from the pouch for short periods and will hitch a ride on the adult female’s back to get from place to place.
